👤 Face Detection Project

This project demonstrates a face detection system using OpenCV and Python (can also be extended with Deep Learning libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch).
It detects human faces in images and video streams in real-time using Haar Cascades / DNN models.

🚀 Features

✅ Real-time face detection using webcam

✅ Detect multiple faces simultaneously

✅ Works on images, video files, and live streams

✅ Lightweight and fast (OpenCV Haar Cascade)

✅ Easily extendable with deep learning models (e.g., SSD, MTCNN, Dlib)

🛠️ Tech Stack

Language: Python 3.x

Libraries:

OpenCV (cv2)

Numpy

(Optional) TensorFlow / PyTorch for advanced detection
